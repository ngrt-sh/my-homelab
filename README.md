# 🚀 The objectives
My homelab's first objective is to find free, self-hosted alternatives to the big GAFAMs. And also to learn more and have fun. Doing this is super cool because you learn, and it's very easy to find free self-hosted alternatives and above all it's for privacy. My main goal with this homelab is to be digitally sovereign and no longer depend as much as possible on the Americans (Google, Microsoft, etc.).

# 🔌  Why I have started to build my homelab?
I started my homelab because I wanted to learn more about what it was, and at first I just wanted to make it a simple storage server, but in the end it turned into a “server of everything”. I did all this to be digitally sovereign and to protect my privacy.

# 🛠️ Roadmap
The roadmap isn't very full because, for the moment, I feel that everything I already have is enough for me. But there are a few things I'd like to invest in:

| Item                                     | Planned for                   | Status |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 2x Seagate 4 TB HDD                      | July/august or september 2025 | ❌     |
| New power suply unit                     | July/august or september 2025 | ❌     |
| New case                                 | July/august or september 2025 | ❌     |
| Firewall to enhance security and control | July/august or september 2025 | ❌     |
