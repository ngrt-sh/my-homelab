# üöÄ The objectives
My homelab's first objective is to find free, self-hosted alternatives to the big GAFAMs. And also to learn more and have fun. Doing this is super cool because you learn, and it's very easy to find free self-hosted alternatives and above all it's for privacy. My main goal with this homelab is to be digitally sovereign and no longer depend as much as possible on the Americans (Google, Microsoft, etc.).

# üîå  Why I have started to build my homelab?
I started my homelab because I wanted to learn more about what it was, and at first I just wanted to make it a simple storage server, but in the end it turned into a ‚Äúserver of everything‚Äù. I did all this to be digitally sovereign and to protect my privacy.

# üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap
The roadmap isn't very full because, for the moment, I feel that everything I already have is enough for me. But there are a few things I'd like to invest in:
- [ ] A firewall for security and control
- [ ] Two 4TB hard disks for data storage 
- [ ] A new enclosure

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Big shout

My homelab can exist by :
 - The Debian community and Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH
 - Also by the Docker developpers and the developpers of the containers I use
 - The homelabers community that inspire me
